Hi, I'm Justin! I'm passionate about technology, always eager to learn and try new things. Recently, I've been building a homelab focused on Kubernetes, where I enjoy tackling real-world enterprise-level challenges and boosting my tech skills.

I also love creating simple yet practical SaaS projects inspired by everyday problems. Lately, blockchain and DeFi have grabbed my attentionâ€”I find it fascinating how these technologies can change how we manage money and interact economically.

Outside of tech, I explore topics like personal development, investing, productivity, fitness, and cardio training. I believe keeping a balance in these areas helps us grow and thrive.

This blog is my personal space to share discoveries, thoughts, challenges, and small victories. Welcome to my world!
