Honestly, who wakes up thinking, _"Hey, what if I spent my Sunday suffering on purpose in front of a terminal, trying to install a super minimalist Linux distribution?"_ 😵‍💫

Arch Linux is like the "extreme sport" of the open-source world: if you miss one step, you can start all over again. Nothing is automated, everything is manual, and the interface... well, it doesn't exist.  
The result? You spend more time on the Wiki than watching Netflix.  
But believe it or not, this "masochistic" approach is also one of the best learning experiences I’ve ever had.

Behind this digital torture, there are real educational benefits if you really want to build a strong foundation. Here's how diving into difficulty helped me grow:

## Understanding the system’s foundations 🔍
First of all, Arch Linux forces you to pay attention to every single installation detail.  
It’s far from "click next and forget" distributions… looking at you, Ubuntu! 👀  
Here, it's more like building IKEA furniture without any instructions: you put every piece together yourself and eventually figure out where those mysterious drafts are coming from 🛠️.

## Strengthening security 🔒
On Arch, you quickly realize that security isn’t just about clicking "Enable" and hoping for the best 🙏.  
Since you build the whole system from scratch, you can set up customized protections right from the start.  
Personally, I went for partition encryption with LVM LUKS — to protect my data while keeping flexibility.  
The result: you secure your machine much better by tweaking every configuration yourself.

## Choosing lightness and customization 🎨
The KISS ("Keep It Simple, Stupid") philosophy also applies to your system’s essential services.  
By installing only what you need, you control everything — from startup to networking — and avoid unnecessary clutter.  
In the end, you get a system that’s as light and reliable as a Swiss watch ⏱️.

Today, I have a system that simply works (and that’s already a big win! 👍).  
Even though it was frustrating at times, it was an incredibly valuable experience — and I totally recommend it.
